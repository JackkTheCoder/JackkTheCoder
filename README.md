👋 Hi! I'm @JackkTheCoder, a Web Developer with a knack for front-end tech and PHP/Laravel backend solutions.

🌐 Skilled in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, WordPress, PHP, and Laravel, I create dynamic websites and applications that stand out. Currently, I'm diving into React and advanced PHP.

🚀 I love tackling challenges that push the boundaries of web development and am eager to collaborate on projects that blend aesthetic interfaces with powerful backend functionalities.

📫 Contact me at jackchristian1202@gmail.com for project collaborations or just to connect!

⚡ Fun fact: I built a complete web app in just 24 hours during a hackathon!
